#  $HOME/.bash_common - Common definitions for both ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc
#
#  Author:   Alisha Awen Sheppard - siren1@disroot.org
#  Created:  2019-002-16
#
#  Note1:    This file is sourced by both $HOME/.bashrc & $HOME/.bash_profile.
#            This is the best-practice method to to get common definitions
#            defined and exported within Interactive, Non-interactive, and Login     
#            shell sessions.  Other methods are not recommended and could cause 
#            problems.  On Stackoverflow, I know "a-lot-of-guys" are sourcing
#            $HOME/.bashrc within: $HOME/.bash_profile, (and I have done so as
#            well in the past) but experts and the Bash manual all warn that this
#            can cause problems with unwanted output to stdout...  Doing it that
#            way will break the non-interactivity of rsync as well as many other
#            things! You will need non-interactive rsync to automate the
#            deployment/updates of your websites!
#
#  Note2:    If you have a legacy .profile file in your $HOME directory,
#            BASH will source it if it does not find any such .bash_profile in
#            there! ".profile" comes from the "wicked-old-days" I remember ;-)  
#            It's still around only because BASH includes it for backward
#            compatibility and that has preserved it due in part on the laziness
#            of sysAdmins and partly due to distro maintainers accommodating those
#            lazy system Administrators to keep them happy and contented.
#            Backwards compatability on a production machine serves no productive
#            purpose!  The objective is to sail your merchant ship as fast as she
#            can go...
#
#  Note3:    Adjust: "Top Level Machine Specific Exports:" sections below to fit
#            your specific environment. ($HOME is universal by default). If $HOME
#            is NOT defined by the system already (can't imagine that on unix)
#            then you will have to define $HOME at the top here as well...
#
#  Change Log: (descending chronological order)
#
#    2019-002-16 - Alisha Awen siren1@disroot.org
#      Created this new file for Bash shell on any machine... Moved a lot of
#      stuff into here that was previously part of $HOME/.bashrc...
#      Now I know why I as experiencing so many shell related problems on
#      my old MacBook Pro from many years ago resulting in switching to Zsh. OMG!
