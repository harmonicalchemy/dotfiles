#  Environment:   GnuPG Version 2 within a Qubes Split GPG Back End VaultVM...
#  Reference:     https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/ (instructions here)
# 
#  This gpg.conf template file contains GnuPG configurations for running in an
#  isolated air-gapped "Back End" Qubes split GPG Vault domain...  Qubes Vault
#  domains are isolated from both networking hardware as well as USB.  In this
#  manner they can function in a similar way to key-cards (only better because
#  this VM has no external drivers configured (including problematic USB)...
# 
#  This file represents my current best practice configuration for GnuPG,
#  running on a Qubes based system.  Use this as a template if you are looking
#  to configure a Qubes based system in a similar way.  (it is probably the
#  most secure way to use GPG2).
#
#  Although this file was tailor made for a Qubes OS based system, there is
#  nothing fancy about it.  This config file contains standard gpg configuration
#  directives read by the GPG configuration parser upon running of each command.
#  You may add any valid long option here on a blank line...  Command line
#  abbreviations or the leading dashes are not allowed within the config files...
#  Simply add your directive on a blank line like this with no leading dashes:
#
#         your-desired-gpg-directive directive-setting
# 
#  NOTE1: All options below are for GnuPG v2.1.11 and later and may not
#         work with earlier versions!
#
#  NOTE2: Although this file mirrors the default_gpg.conf in the top level
#         GnuPG folder within this repository I have removed all the
#         pedigogical notes showing GnuPG defaults, obsolete, and dangerous
#         settings.  This file contains only the directives needed to implement
#         Qubes Split GPG within an air-gapped VaultVM.
#
#  Change Log: (descending chronological order)
#
#    2019-003-17 - Alisha Awen Sheppard - siren1@disroot.org
#      GnuPG V2.2 has been out for a while.  I am double checking all my
#      settings below to see if there are any new (more secure) methods to use...

##
# The default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key
# is the first key found in the secret key ring... Use a signing sub-key
# rather than your primary key.  Qubes Split GPG does not expose your
# primary secret key to the light of day... Never take it out while
# connected on line... You won't need to take it out much as your
# sub-keys can be delegated to perform most of the work...
# (replace with your signing sub-key [S] fingerprint)
# NOTE: You can apply this multiple times for more than one key.  In this
#       case, the last key for which a secret key is available is used.

##
# How to Display key IDs:
# "none" omits the short ID and instead shows the key's full fingerprint on a 
# separate line.  "0xlong" displays the longer more accurate 16-char key ID.
# I choose "0xlong For practical reasons of searching keys etc., but I always
# confirm the actual "fingerprint" of someone's key before importing it!

# Always show full fingerprints of keys List, (all keys or the specified ones)

# If you do not use the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) charset, you should tell GnuPG which
# is the native character set.  Please check the man page for supported character
# sets.  This character set is only used for metadata and not for the actual
# message which does not undergo any translation.  Note that future version of
# GnuPG will change to UTF-8 as default character set.

# TODO: Find out if this needs to be set now that you are using
#       GnuPG > 2.2.x)

## VALID and important keyserver Options:

##
#  --honor-pka-record:
#  If --auto-key-retrieve is used (an obsolete feature now), and the signature 
#  being verified has a PKA record, then use the PKA info to fetch the key.
#  This is the default enabled option for GPG2!  I am opting to disable it here 
#  for tighter security.  My configuration uses: pool.sks-keyservers.net to 
#  retrieve keys...  keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve is now obsolete so you
#  don't have to worry about disablig that anymore...
keyserver-options no-honor-pka-record

##
# Automatic key location - Locate a key using what has been defined by the
# --kyeyserver option within dirmngr.conf - Again, this back end vault is not
# connected (air-gapped) so dirmngr.conf is a no-op here. These options are
# for the App VM side of things... Therefore his option is a dummy here as well.
