#                 Options for (dummy) Dirmngr running in an isolated air-gaped

#  Environment:   GnuPG Version 2 within a Qubes Split GPG Back End VaultVM...
#  Reference:     https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/ (instructions here)
#
#  The Qubes Split GPG back end is an air-gapped vault VM that is isolated from
#  both networking hardware as well as USB... Because of this, dirmngr should
#  be disabled since it will not be able to connect to the keyservers...
#
#  Configurations below are intented to keep dirmngr, (if invoked) set to exit
#  gracefully and not bother to even try... You probably don't even need this...
#
#  NOTE: All options below are for GnuPG v2.1.11 and later and may not
#        work with earlier versions!
#
#  Change Log: (descending chronological order)
#
#    2019-003-17 - Alisha Awen Sheppard - siren1@disroot.org
#      GnuPG V2.2 has been out for a while.  I am double checking all my
#      settings below to see if there are any new (more secure) methods to use...

#    2018-004-20 - Alisha Awen Sheppard - siren1@disroot.org
