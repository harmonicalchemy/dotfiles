# Dotfiles 

(`.dotfiles` & `.conf` files for `MacOS` & other `nx` environments)

## Introduction:

These are collected configuration/initialization files I use on a daily basis on `MacOS` and other `nx` environments.  Mostly similar to all those other **TMI** `.dotfile` repos out there.  I have private projects hosted on Bitbucket.  I have learned a lot from public Github projects, but I have not contributed any myself yet...  So here goes with my first **_public_** repository on Github.  Good enough for a start eh? ;-) 

I created this repository initially to make these files available within my Qubes Laptop working environment without having to do risky USB memory stick transfers...

Within my Qubes development VM, I can use git and SSH to get them more securely.

Most of this stuff is OS agnostic, while the MacOS folder is for MacOS _(darwin)_ only...

More info and instructions will be written later here after I incorporate it into my other development and server environments...

More `.conf` files for GnuPG, SSH, and other processes, (both local and servers) will be added later as well... This is just the beginning...

I hope someone ends up finding this useful. ;-)
