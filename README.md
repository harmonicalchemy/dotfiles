## Introduction:

I created this project back in February of 2018 to gather, organize, and curate all the configuration/initialization files I use on a daily basis on different `unix` and _unix-like_ environments.  This projet is similar to all those other **_TMI_** `.dotfile` repos out there but this one is much simpler and initially mostly a "manual" configuration project... It may be easier to study these dotfiles if you are a beginner.  I am a writer and include lots of informative documentation (as comments within the files themselves) ;-)

I have hosted private projects hosted on Bitbucket for several years now and I have learned a lot from public Github projects, but I had not contributed anything public to Github myself yet...  This was my first **_public_** repository on Github.  It was good enough for a start I guess but now a year later I feel making it public was a premature move at the time...

## Update 2019:

I have revamped this entire project!  Over the year I made a lot of changes and set up multiplatform capabilities.  I am still in the process of debugging this on Mac OS however.  On Mac OS you have to start Emacs from the shell due to some possible problems with my .dotfiles, the cause of which is still a mystery.  Linux Platforms are working smoothly now...

Consider this my first tier (manual setup) which requires you to install things manually first.  Once this is working well, I will begin the next tier of automating everything so that all one
will have to do it clone this repository and run a shell script from the command line...  That automation will also _(optionally)_ install Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs as a final step in the process...  None of that automation is incorporated here yet...  The automation tier will also include remote server configuration and deployment scripts.

This project is ready for public examination and beta testing only.  Please don't rely on this for your perminant setup until I let you know that things are much more stable. I will let you know at the top of this document when that happens...  

This README will include instructions for manual operation in later commits... Comming soon...  I hope someone ends up finding this useful. ;-)

**Important Disclamer:** Verify anything you find here with other sources as well.  Be informed about this stuff!  Especially the security things like GnuPG, OpenSSH, and OpenSSL!  I am releasing this for pedagogical purposes only, and assume no responsibility for any problems you may encounter trying to implement what you learned here.  Read the GNU license agreement... "Absolutely No Warranty" Thanks. ;-)  I hate legal stuff... But it is a necessary thing in this current world we live in...
