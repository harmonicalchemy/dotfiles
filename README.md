# Dotfiles I use for `MacOS` & other `nx` environments

## Introduction:

These are collected `.dotfiles` that I use on a daily basis within both MacOS and other `nx` environments.

I created this repository initially to make these files available within my Qubes Laptop working environment... Most of this stuff is OS agnostic, while the MacOS folder is for MacOS (darwin) only...

More info and instructions will be written later here after I incorporate it into my other development and server environments...
