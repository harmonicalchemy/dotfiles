# Dotfiles 

(`.dotfiles` & `.conf` files for `MacOS` & other `nx` environments)

## Introduction:

These are collected configuration/initialization files I use on a daily basis on `MacOS` and other `nx` environments.  Mostly similar to all those other .dotfile repos out there.   I hope someone finds this useful in a world full of this kind of TMI!

I created this repository initially to make these files available within my Qubes Laptop working environment without having to do risky USB memory stick transfers...

Within my Qubes development VM, I can use git and SSH to get them more securely,  Most of this stuff is OS agnostic, while the MacOS folder is for MacOS _(darwin)_ only...

More info and instructions will be written later here after I incorporate it into my other development and server environments...

I hope someone finds this useful. ;-)
