# Harmonic Alchemy .dotfiles - V1.2  [Q1-2020]

(`.dotfiles` & `.conf` files for `MacOS` & other `nx` environments)

## Introduction:

I created this project back in February of 2018 to gather, organize, and curate all the configuration/initialization files I use on a daily basis on different `unix` and _unix-like_ environments.  This projet is similar to all those other **_TMI_** `.dotfile` repos out there but this one is much simpler and initially mostly a "manual" configuration project... It may be easier to study these dotfiles if you are a beginner.  I am a writer and include lots of informative documentation (as comments within the files themselves) ;-)

I have hosted private projects hosted on Bitbucket for several years now and I have learned a lot from public Github projects, but I had not contributed anything public to Github myself yet...  This was my first **_public_** repository on Github.  It was good enough for a start and now it is even better...  

I hope someone ends up finding this useful. ;-)

## Update 2020:

I have been neglecting this repository for most of 2019 leaving it at V1.0 RC2.  That has changed now...  Many most of these files have been updated from my Private `.DOTFILES` repository.  Many things in my "real" .dotfiles needs to be removed before committing to my public Github account.

But that task is now done and I am going to let it sit for a while before calling it a final full release to version 2.0.  Unfortunately testing the code is kind of indirect since the files are different...  But hopefully this should be pretty stable now...

My Mac OS problems of a year ago are all gone now... Mostly that was from having an Emacs build that did not work well on Mac OS...  Now I have Emacs built locally from source on my Mac.  On Linux machines everything is a breeze as well...

This project is ready for public examination and testing.  You will have to add your specific things to these dotfiles before it will work on your system.  I put generous comments in the code so you should not have too much trouble figuring things out...

**Important Disclamer:** Verify anything you find here with other sources as well.  Be informed about this stuff!  Especially the security things like GnuPG, OpenSSH, and OpenSSL!  I am releasing this for pedagogical purposes only, and assume no responsibility for any problems you may encounter trying to implement what you learned here.  Read the GNU license agreement... "Absolutely No Warranty" Thanks. ;-)  I hate legal stuff... But it is a necessary thing in this current world we live in...
