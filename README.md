# Dotfiles 

(`.dotfiles` & `.conf` files for `MacOS` & other `nx` environments)

## Introduction:

These are collected configuration/initialization files I use on a daily basis on `MacOS` and other `nx` environments.  Mostly similar to all those other **TMI** `.dotfile` repos out there.  I have private projects hosted on Bitbucket, however I have learned a lot from public Github projects, but I have not contributed any myself yet...  So here goes with my first **_public_** repository on Github.  Good enough for a start eh? ;-) 

**Please be advised:**  This is a work in progress.  I am still in the process of adding files, debugging, etc.  When everything is totally ready for public use I will let you know at the top of this document...  Regardless of that, please verify anything you find here with other sources as well.  Be informed about this stuff!  Especially the security things like GnuPG, OpenSSH, and OpenSSL!  I am releasing this for pedagogical purposes only, and assume no responsibility for any problems you may encounter trying to implement what you learned here.  Read the GNU license agreement... "Absolutely No Warranty" Thanks. ;-)

I created this repository initially to make these files available within my Qubes Laptop working environment without having to do risky USB memory stick transfers...

Within my Qubes development VM, I can use git and SSH to get them more securely.

Most of this stuff is OS agnostic, (except MS Windows which I don't keep up with or use) The MacOS folder is for MacOS _(darwin)_ specifics only...

More info and instructions will be written later here after I incorporate it into my other development and server environments and give everything a good review...

More `.conf` files for GnuPG, SSH, and other processes, (both local and servers) will be added later as well... This is just the beginning...

I hope someone ends up finding this useful. ;-)
