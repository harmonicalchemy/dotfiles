##                Global Multiplatform ZSH Configs for: Non Interactive Shells...

## $HOME/.zshenv is always sourced by ZSH upon startup, (all modes)... 
## This file  is also sourced first before any of the other config files...
## Therefore this file is an excellent place to define common configs needed for
## all situations. (interactive, non-interactive, login, etc.) $PATH definitions
## (used by all modes) will be set exclusively within this file only...
## No need to duplicate things unnecessarily, which could also cause unexpected
## side effects!  Everything else defined here is intended for: NON INTERACTIVE
## use exclusively. Anything that sends output to the screen, or
## expects a human response, should not be defined within this file...

## This simple version of Harmonic Alchemy "Dotfiles" does not need to do
## anything fancy like define $ZDOTDIR. Also there is no current need for a
## .zlogin, .zlogout, or .zprofile.  _yet_  There are no current plans for these
## extra config files until I reach a more automated dotfiles stage with auto configs
## for remote VPS host environments folded in...  First lets get this all working
## great manually...

## Please do add/remove definitions depending on your particular machine
## environment(s) but please try to keep the structure and sections below the
## same as they are now... There is a reason for that!  Add your custom mods
## within the sections that they belong in.  Please don't try to move sections
## around etc.  You may break some things!  Be careful...  Sections are well
## defined below with comment banners for us dumb humans to be able to read...

## Change Log: (descending chronological order)

## 2022-001-18 - Alisha Awen - Siren1@disroot.org
##     Refreshed (synced) this file to match generic changes made to my private
##     .DOTFILES repository...  (all docs are up to date as well)
##     Performed Security DueDiligence for Q1 2022...
##     This commit marks Harmonic Alchemy .DOTFILES as: Version 2.0

## 2021-012-24 - Alisha Awen - siren1disroot.org
##     Updated this file with mods made to my private DOTFILES version of this
##     file... Minor changes to PATH, etc... Major reformatting of comments to
##     match the style within my Public DOTFILES version of this file... Headings
##     were changed to aid with this public version. Some settings previously in
##     .zshrc were put here (to match what I did with .bashrc and .bash_common...
##     Performed security due diligence work for 2022

## 2021-012-24 - Alisha Awen - siren1disroot.org
##     Updating this file from my Private DOTFILES version to sync with latest
##     changes before commit to public DOTFILES repository...
##     Performing security due diligence work for 2022... 

## 2020-002-02 - Alisha Awen - siren1disroot.org
##     Copied this file fresh from .zshenv on my private .DOTFILES repo.
##     Performed some security due diligence work for 2020... 

## 2019-006-26 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     HUGE OVERHAUL for Mac OS mostly...  Also added debug print
##     statements... (that will be commented out when not debugging)...

## 2019-005-16 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     This file needed an overhaul after all the troubleshooting over several
##     months (both Mac OS and Linux).  I cleaned this up and also added some
##     settings copied from [vault-pgp] .bash_common which may fix some issues I
##     am having trying to get git-remote-gcrypt to work...  The structure here
##     is now simpler...    I hope I did not break anything!
##     I am on [MWM-work] now.  I will have to test this on Rodrigo next...
##     Still no fix for Emacs environment vars problem... Boot from shell works.

## 2019-003-16 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     While I am troubleshooting Mac OS problems, I am now trying this on my 
##     older Macbook Pro to see how things go with Mac OS El Capitan, which is
##     no longer supported by Apple or Homebrew.  If I can get this working there
##     that will be a nice thing for folks who can only afford cheap old Macs
##     (i.e., The "real" rest of us, if a Mac is still that computer for the rest
##     of us that is)...  My first serious home box was a used refurbished
##     Mac IIx (that was a long time ago)...  It was still considered pretty
##     powerful when I got it. (it was my first Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)
##     for making music back around 1995) ;-)

## 2019-002-14 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     I have been troubleshooting Zsh problems on Mac OS for a while... 
##     First environment variables and now Zsh is not loading correctly...
##     I believe I have a lame Mac OS solution running now. (with band-aid)
##     So far on Mac OS it is working as long as you start Emacs from the shell.
##     Qubes (Fedora 29, Debian 9) etc. work nicely now...

## 2019-002-08 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     Reorganized this file to make it multiplatform like its companion .zshrc...

## 2019-001-24 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     Copied most (except one or two) exports from .zshrc to this new file...
##     Also copied some things from old legacy .profile into here as well...
##     Removed .profile from my Mac OS $HOME.  Not needed anymore according to
##     BASH official docs...  I am still trying to get Emacs environment in sync
##     with Zsh, Bash, etc...
