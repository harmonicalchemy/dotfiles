## This config file is only sourced by BASH when your session is both "human
## interactive" and also non-login (i.e., you are invoking manually from the
## system's default Terminal.  It is not sourced when logging in, either remotely
## from another machine, or even locally from something like an X11 virtual
## terminal, browser, etc. which is basically the same thing as a remote login
## coming from the outside (above) the "shell" layer of the OS.  Because of this
## "Born Again Satanic-Hell rule" (lol ;-), I created $HOME/.bash_common which
## is sourced from both $HOME/.bash_profile & this $HOME./bashrc. Using your own
## $HOME/.bash_common is the preferred best-practice method.  An alternate method
## that "a-lot-of-guys" (including me in the past) do of sourcing $HOME/.bashrc
## from $HOME/.bash_profile can cause many problems!  I learned the "hard" way...

## Note1: If you have a legacy .profile file in your $HOME directory,
##        BASH will source it if it does not find any such .bash_profile in
##        there! ".profile" comes from the "wicked-old-days" I remember ;-)  
##        It's still around only because BASH includes it for backward
##        compatibility and that has preserved it due in part on the laziness
##        of sysAdmins and partly due to distro maintainers accommodating those
##        lazy system Administrators to keep them happy and contented.
##        Backwards compatability on a production machine serves no productive
##        purpose!  The objective is to sail your merchant ship as fast as she
##        can go...

## Change Log: (descending chronological order)

## 2021-012-22 - Alisha Awen - Siren1@disroot.org
##     Updated this file and put it in new .bash.d sub-directory:
##     .DOTFILES Security DueDiligence done up to: Q4 2021 now...

## 2021-006-003 - Alisha Awen - Siren1@disroot.org
##     Minor changes and fixes (mostly for Mac OS which is set to
##     zsh at the OS level so BASH is rarely invoked.  Except for
##     remote logins etc... (and now I have the git user logging
##     in remotely from other machines) which is how I found out
##     how messed up my BASH was for Mac OS... lol

## 2020-002-002 - Alisha Awen - Siren1@disroot.org
##     Updated this file from my private .DOTFILES repo...
##     Security DueDiligence up to Q1 2020 now...

## 2019-006-26 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     Completely re-wrote this file all over yet again!  We can now handle
##     BASH INTERACTIVE & NON-INTERACTIVE Shells...   Added debug print
##     statements... (that will be commented out when not debugging)...

## 2019-002-14 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     At this point this file is completely new again.  Most everthing was taken
##     from .zshrc...  Then many things were removed and placed into:
##     $HOME/.bash_common. I should probably change the creation date as well...
##     Now I know why I as experiencing so many shell related problems on
##     my old MacBook Pro from many years ago resulting in switching to Zsh. OMG!
##     This file is now  multiplatform for Linux and Mac OS and possibly other
##     BSD flavors with a few tweaks.  Windows Cygwin support is not yet planned
##     but could come later if there is a strong need...

## 2018-002-26 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     Made this file generic and added it to my Github .dotfiles repository...

## 2014-006-09 - Alisha Awen - siren1@disroot.org
##     I copied this file from my old MacBook Pro when I was still using the
##     Bash shell.  I was not sure of the exact creation date when I added
##     this header to the top of this file...

    ## Install Powerline Status Line Prompt:

    ## NOTE: First install Powerline Package from your Linux distro
    ##       to make this feature available for BASH to use...
    ##       Or, you could install it with pip3...

    ## NEXT: (after installing) set up symbolic link from $HOME/.powerline
    ##       to: (where the distro or you installed /powerline/bash/powerline.sh
    ##       which will be a different place depending on the distro install or
    ##       which version of Python you are using... etc. etc. etc.  This will
    ##       all be different depending on your OS and platform!!!
    ##       Therefore to keep thins simple put that symbolic link in your home
    ##       directory and keep it up to date if you upgrade python or re-install
    ##       powerline some other way... That's much easier than putting a bunch
    ##       of if/else if statements below... and then having to update that!!!

    ## On Linux The following are specialized and optional if needed:
    ## You probably won't want to enable this unless you are trying to remap
    ## keys for easier use of your fingers etc.  (see: Emacs Xah-Fly-Keys)

    ## ZSH only: Make Caps_Lock key do HOME key AND CAPS_LOCK is disabled!!
    ## Note: This is not set in BASH because those environments use a stripped
    ## down version of Emacs that has a much smaller attack surface...
    ## Those environments require simpler, more secure BASH with plain vanilla
    ## Emacs.  No bells or whistles to get exploited...

    ## This is for Emacs Xah-Fly-Keys (to make those keys fast & efficient)
    ## NOTE: You may decide to instead Swap Caps_Lock and HOME so that you
    ## don't loose the Caps_Lock toggle...  I don't need it but...
    ## A current side effect of the above is: If for some reason Caps Lock gets
    ## set before the Caps_Lock key gets mapped away to HOME then I have no
    ## way to turn it off without re-mapping the key back...  A pain!!!
    ## Swapping Caps_Lock with HOME turns out to be a magic art I am still
    ## not privileged to have knowledge of!!! (i.e., nothing I tried, worked)

#    xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap

    ## Also on Linux (everywhere) get rid of middle mouse button! This is
    ## something I have hated since the early days that SUN introduced it
    ## into the X Windows system...  Middle Mouse button is a UX hazard!
    ## SmallTalk did not need it, and neither did Apple... Both strong
    ## environments for a mouse to play in.. no middle button needed!
    ## Except to deploy that god mode smart bomb in your hacked video game.
    ## but then just use a key on the home row for that eh?  ;-)
