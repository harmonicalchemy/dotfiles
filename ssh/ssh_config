#  Environment:   Any machine that supports Open SSH (recent versions)...
#
#  Generic System Wide client SSH Configurations...
#
#  This file could be used as your system wide SSH config file on
#  any unix/bsd/Linux compatible OS you need to build on a PC for local
#  development, etc...  In addition you could simply copy everything below to
#  the bottom of your $HOME/.ssh/config file.  Open SSH does not care as long
#  as it is contained in one of the files that Open SSH parses by default...
# 
#  Note: The Open SSH configuration parser takes the first value for any
#  directive it finds: (first: from the command line, second: from local
#  $HOME/.ssh/config, and third: from this system wide /etc/ssh/ssh_config file
#  which is used by ALL local user accounts intended for the OS your are building.
#
#  If the configuration parser finds a duplicate keyword configuration directive
#  set later it will ignore it... Keep this in mind when you use these examples
#  to set up your own configurations. This generic section should be put last in
#  your chain allowing you to set directives for a single host specific purpose,
#  beforehand. Your specific HOST directives set earlier, will override any
#  generic settings made here for default connections...

##
# BEGIN Default Generic Host Section:
# (copy this as the last section of ~/.ssh/config if you are doing this for
# your home or work computer and have only one user account on it besides root.
# Note: These will NOT override any duplicates set earlier, a behavior which may
# be your intention.  If not, watch out, could be a bug! (read info in header)
##
HOST *

# ALWAYS Use the stronger protocol 2!
  Protocol 2

# Enable Public Key Authentication...
  PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Key eXchange Algorithms:
# Limit Key Exchange to: curve22519-sha256 only within this default HOST *
# section...
  KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org

# Host Key Algorithms:
# Limit HostKeyAlgorithms to: ssh-ed25519 only within this default HOST *
# section...
  HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519

# Cyphers:
# Limit Cyphers to: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com only within this default
# HOST * section...
  Ciphers  chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com

# Message Authentication Codes (MACs):
# Limit MACs to: hmac-sha2-512 only within this default HOST * section...
  MACs  hmac-sha2-512

# IdentitiesOnly:
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# Challenge Response Authentication:
# Enable Challenge Response Authentication only if you need to use One Time
# Password (OTP), or Timed One Time Password (TOPT), e.g., yubikey, google auth,
# etc.
  ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# General SSH configurations for tuning performance etc...
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  ServerAliveCountMax 30
    
# Display randomâ€”ASCII-art representation of remote host key fingerprint at
# login & for unknown host keys to make it easier to recognize...
# Enable this if you think it will help you verify host you are trying to
# connect to...  It would be better if the images were a real graphic rather
# than ASCII art which is almost as difficult as recognizing the code itself.
# Security at the expense of usability comes at the expense of security.
  VisualHostKey yes

# Hash names & addresses within ~/.ssh/known_hosts so they can only be read by
# ssh & sshd, (no 3rd parties can read)
  HashKnownHosts yes

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# The rest of these should all be disabled...  They may be depreciated as well.
# Use the -v (verbose) option when you connect to find out.  if you see a line
# saying the option is depreciated, you can remove it from here to get rid of
# that message.  UseRoaming has been depreciated since OpenSSH V7.0. So you
# no longer need to set it below to mitigate that famous bug!  I keep it
# commented out in here for reference, and also in the rare case I might be
# forced to to set up an older machine with an older version of SSH.
# In that case,  I will see it and remember to set it to protect that older
#  version of OpenSSH...
  PasswordAuthentication no
#  UseRoaming no
  ForwardAgent no
  ForwardX11 no
