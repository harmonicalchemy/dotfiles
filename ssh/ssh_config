# /etc/ssh/ssh_config - Generic System Wide client SSH Configurations...
# Last Modified: 2018-March-02 - Alisha Awen Siren1@disroot.org
#
# This file could be added to a template that sets up the root files on
# any unix/bsd/Linux compatable OS you need to build for either local
# development, Personal Computer, or web server...  In addition you could
# simply add everything below to the bottom of your $HOME/.ssh/config file.
# 
# Note: The OpenSSH configuration parsor takes the first value for any
# directive it finds: (first: from the command line, second: from local
# $HOME/.ssh/config, and third: from this system wide /etc/ssh/ssh_config file
# which is used by ALL local user accounts intended for the OS your are building.
#
# If the configuration parsor finds a duplicate keyword configuration directive
# set later it will ignore it... Keep this in mind when you use these examples
# to set up your own configurations. This generic section should be put last in
# your chain allowing you to set directives for a single host specific purpose,
# beforehand. Your specific HOST directives set earlier, will override any
# generic settings made here for default connections...

#####
# BEGIN Default Generic Host Section:
# (copy this as the last section of ~/.ssh/config if you are doing this for
# your home or work computer and have only one user account ont it besides root.
# Note: These will NOT override any duplicates set earlier, a behavior which may
# be your intention.  If not, watch out, could be a bug! (read info in header)
#
# NOTE: Connection to my own VPS machines is set to as narrow and secure attack
# surface as possible.  The default settings below reflect this strict nature.
# Connection to other services may require overrides within their respective
# HOST sections in order to negotiate a matching configuration with those
# services.  Specific HOST sections are usually NOT set in /etc/ssh/ssh_config.
##
HOST *

# ALWAYS Use the stronger protocol 2!
    Protocol 2

# Enable Public Key Authentication...
    PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Key eXchange Algorithms:
# Limit Key Exchange to: curve22519-sha256 only within this default HOST *
# section...
    KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org

# Host Key Algorithms:
# Limit HostKeyAlgorithms to: ssh-ed25519 only within this default HOST *
# section...
    HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519

# Cyphers:
# Limit Cyphers to: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com only within this default
# HOST * section...
    Ciphers  chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com

# Message Authentication Codes (MACs):
# Limit MACs to: hmac-sha2-512 only within this default HOST * section...
    MACs  hmac-sha2-512

# IdentitiesOnly:
    IdentitiesOnly yes

# Challenge Response Authentication:
# Enable Challenge Response Authentication only if you need to use One Time
# Password (OTP), or Timed One Time Password (TOPT), e.g., yubikey, google auth,
# etc.
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# General SSH configurations for tuning performance etc...
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 30
    
# Display randomâ€”ASCII-art representation of remote host key fingerprint at
# login & for unknown host keys to make it easier to recognize...
# Enable this if you think it will help you verify host you are trying to
# connect to...  It would be better if the images were a real graphic rather
# than ASCII art which is almost as difficult as recognizing the code itself.
# Security at the expense of usability comes at the expense of security.
    VisualHostKey yes

# Hash names & addresses within ~/.ssh/known_hosts so they can only be read by
# ssh & sshd, (no 3rd parties can read)
    HashKnownHosts yes

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# The rest of these should all be disabled...  They may be depreciated as well.
# Use the -v (verbose) option when you connect to find out.  if you see a line
# saying the option is depreciated, you can remove it from here to get rid of
# that message.  UseRoaming has been depreciated since OpenSSH V7.0.  I keep it
# here for reference, and also in the rare case I have to set up a machine with
# an older version of SSH.  I will see it and remember to set it for that older
# installed version of OpenSSH...
    PasswordAuthentication no
#    UseRoaming no
    ForwardAgent no
    ForwardX11 no
