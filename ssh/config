##                Local User's $HOME SSH Configurations...
## Created:       2018-003-11 
## Updated:       2022-001-17
## Author:        Alisha Awen - siren1@HarmonicAlchemy.productions
## GitHub User:   harmonicalchemy
## Release:       https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html
## Ref:           https://www.openssh.com/manual.html
## Spec Sheet:    https://www.openssh.com/specs.html
## Repo:          GitHub.com:harmonicalchemy/dotfiles.git
## Environment:   Any machine that supports Open SSH      (be wise and update!)

## This example SSH config (for any user's $HOME directory) is for specific HOST
## sections created to meet special requirements that the global HOST * section
## can't or would'nt be recommended to handle independently.  Conslut the file:
## /etc/ssh/ssh_config within this same directory for an example of what the
## global HOST * section looks like.

##                *** OpenSSH CURRENT STATUS Q1-2022 ***
##
## See: https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/ChangeLog
## The latest version of OpenSSH: 8.8/8.8p1 was released on 2021-09-26. 
## Read the release file here: https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.1
## This release is generably availble from various package managers.
## It's Always Time to UPDATE your security infrastructure & tools!!!
## Don't be lazy when it comes to infoSec!  "It's like a Jungle Sometimes,
## It makes me wonder how I keep from going under!  Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh" -GMF

## As of Q1-2022 the following algorithms are still the strongest. They don't
## depend on any suspicious Government tweaks, constants, etc. that can 
## compromise the integrity of your OpenSSH configuration...

## HostKeyAlgorithms:
##
##     Use ED25519 if at all possible, and when you cant, fall back on
##     the traditional RSA 4096 method...
##                 DON'T USE ANY ECDSA CURVE KEYS!!!

## Using the examples in this file, copy and/or rename a specific <named> HOST
## section below for any host that requres special treatment.  Change its name
## to the name of your special host or service requiring special treatment.
## (e.g., service1, service2, legacy-host1, uncomplient-host2, etc.).

## Override keyword directives set within the global HOST * section that do not
## match the reqirements of your difficult host or service by setting those same
## keyword directives within your special named host section below, using a
## different attribute that does match your difficult host's requirements...

## Note: This method works well because the OpenSSH configuration parsor takes
## the first value for any directive it finds: (first: from the command line,
## second: from this local $HOME/.ssh/config, and third: from the system wide
## /etc/ssh/ssh_config file which is used by ALL local user accounts intended
## for the OS your are building or modifying.  It is for this reason the global
## HOST * section must be placed last within (any) file you put it in (which
## could be at the bottom of this file as well, if that is your choosing rather
## than using a single system wide: /etc/ssh/ssh_config file.

## In other words: If the SSH configuration parsor finds a duplicate keyword
## configuration directive set later during it's parsing journey, it will ignore
## it... Keep this in mind when you use these examples to set up your own
## configurations.  Happy con-fog-uring and debugging! - Alisha ;-)

####
##                 *** KEYPAIR SECURITY BEST PRACTICE ***
####

## While configuring your specific use-case HOST Sections below, It is
## IMPORTANT to use a different keypair (hopefully ed25519) for each client
## system you use to connect to any remote service or server...

## The generic examples below show one Host Section for GitHub, Bitbucket,
## and one or two example templates for your own private HOST configurations...

## You will need to duplicate and modify the examples below for each client
## machine you use to connect with the same remote service over SSH...
## In other words, not only will you be generating different keys for each
## Remote Host you connect to, but also you will generate different keys
## on each client machine needing to connect to those remote services...

## You will have to manage a lot of keys! But this is how you can divide
## up and distribute risk so any one breach does not take the entier HOUSE
## down in one blaze! (so to speak)... This kikd of security policy that will
## make you safer in the long run like a ship with many air-tight compartments
## is hard to sink!

## However your daily Damage Control Process must be simple or else your crew,
## (You if you are a lone sailor) will "mutiny" and you WILL loose all security
## took so much pain to set up!

## Keep a Tight Ship and your damage controll events will be minimized, your
## defensive power sustained...

## Why? - Becasue if one of your keys leaks, you have a better chance of figuring
## out which of you client systems got compromized! All your other systems and
## keys will be fine!  This approach works well in a compartmentalized Qubes 4.0
## based setup. Just like a state of the art battleship Qubes OS is!
## Official Website:  https://www.qubes-os.org/

## Suffice it to say... Protect your private keys at all costs! Don't expose them
## if at all possible... Qubes Split SSH is porbably the best way to do this,
## (if you use Qubes, fantastic... You most likely know how to do this stuff)

## OK Mate? Now go sail your boat! Arrrr!

## Optional: The next best thing is to use a YubiKey on an air-gapped OpenBSD
## based system, in conjunction with a strong Password Vault...
## See this article: https://fedoramagazine.org/managing-credentials-with-keepassxc/
## for more information on how to set that up... Read the sections titled:
## "Creating your Wallet", and "SSH agent integration"

## Note: If you use USB keys, be extra careful using the USB interface and
## driver(s) installed on your machine!

## USB is volunerable and a prime target of some sophisticated mallware!
## Make sure the USB key you use is brand new from a company that is well
## known for best security practices...  YubiKey has the best reputation...
## This must be a virgin key... Not used for anything else yet... If at all
## possible use it on devices which have a USB port and driver configured so
## that it is not used for anything else!  (i.e., no other USB devices were ever
## plugged into it... Your OpenSSH based machine will use your YubiKey as a
## private Vault! Do not to use this device for other things..  Got it? 

## These are general guidelines requiring research... Your milage and
## use-case may vary...  There are good articles on this subject but there
## are others that are out-of-date or worse... Misleading Trash! I may
## end up writing one myself... See the Docs folder in Harmonic Alchemy
## Dotfiles for guides I have already written... I plan on publishing more
## in 2020...  Stay tuned...

## BEGIN Specific Host Section:

## Update 2022-001-17:
##    Some of the info below may not be necessary anymore... 
##    Instructions may change soon!  The ITEF item below was porposed in 2017!
##    See the current ITEF guidelines for updated info about minimum recommended
##    Difffie-Hellman group exchange settings:
##       https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8270
##
## Correction:
##    Instructions Below WILL change soon...
##    One thing is guaranteed... Change happens with time!
##    Verify Instructions against new ITEF standards before blindly
##    following them... I wrote this back in 2019

## Note:
##    For any HOST section below, if you have to set KexAlgorithms to:
##    diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256, (custom DH with SHA2) you also
##    need to do the following: (Note: see avove link. The instructions below
##    may need to be updated... I'm NOT working on that as I don't need it. ;-)
##    Your milage may vary...

##    Open /etc/ssh/moduli if exists, and delete lines where the 5th column is
##    less than 2000 as follows:
##       $> awk '$5 > 2000' /etc/ssh/moduli > "${HOME}/moduli"
##       $> wc -l "${HOME}/moduli"
##           (make sure there is something left! if not forget this
##            and skip below to create a new /etc/ssh/moduli)
##       $> mv "${HOME}/moduli" /etc/ssh/moduli

##    If /etc/ssh/moduli does not exist, create it as follows:
##       $> ssh-keygen -G /etc/ssh/moduli.all -b 4096
##       $> ssh-keygen -T /etc/ssh/moduli.safe -f /etc/ssh/moduli.all
##       $> mv /etc/ssh/moduli.safe /etc/ssh/moduli
##       $> rm /etc/ssh/moduli.all
##    This will take a while as it runs intensive calculations of rounds...

### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## HOST Github.com:
## Try this limited configuration set "as-is" here first, (wihch is considedred
## to be the best reasonably secure configuration for GIthub).

## If you run into probelms connecting, (and you have debugged to make sure you
## have not done something elsewhere incorrectly) try adding some of the other
## suggested settings within this comment (one at a time) until you get things
## connecting successfully. Using the -v (verbose) option with your SSH
## command gives more info while debugging.  Adding more than one -v options to
## the SSH command line will increase the amout of info that gets displayed...

## NOTE: According to Stribika (and other security experts):
## (https://github.com/stribika/stribika.github.io/wiki/Secure-Secure-Shell)
## Github needs KexAlgorithms: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 some of the
## time but not always. diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 is only 1024 bits
## which does not offer a sufficient enough security margin these days.
## I tried: curve25519-sha256@libssh.org and it worked for me!  Hopefully it
## will work for you as well...  I believe you could use the directives set
## within this Github section for Heroku as well...
## (with possibly a few minor adjustments)

## The following are the only SSH config options still considerd reasonably
## secure that ARE known to be supported by Github if you run into problems
## you could try some of these.  They are listed in decending order from
## strongest to weakest security...

## KexAlgorithms:
##  My first choice:
##    curve25519-sha256@libssh.org
##    This seems to be the only key exchange algo accpeted by Github (besides
##    other unsecure ones) however it is the best Kex algo available, and my
##    first choice...
##
##  You could try this one as well but is has not been confirmed to work
##  with Github:
##    diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 (See Note: at top of this file)
##
##  Only try this last option as a last resort for Github (after trying
##  everything else you can think of - it is not secure. (see Note: above):
##    diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1

## Chiphers:
##    chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com  (this one is best and my first choice)
##    aes256-ctr
##    aes192-ctr
##    aes128-ctr

## MACs:
##    hmac-sha2-512  (this one is best and my first choice)
##    hmac-sha2-256

## IdentityFile:
##    (I could not get ed25519 to be accepted so I created a 4096 rsa key)
##    This may change in the future hopefully...

HOST github.com

  HostName github.com

  ## For git to do her job, set her as the "user" for git commands.
  ## This works with testing as well: ($ ssh -v -T github.com)...

  user git

  ## Host Key Algorithms:
  ##   Since 2019 I prefer to use ssh-ed25519 exclusively...
  ##   But RSA 4096 is fine if I can't have that...
  ##   (all of this is going to be mute in another 5 to 10 years however!)
  ##   If Github finally decides to implement ssh-ed25519,
  ##   switch to that one below for HostKeyAlgorithms:

  HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-rsa
  #HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519

  ## Identity File:

  ##   But RSA 4096 is fine if I can't have that...

  ##   In 2020, I tried ed25519, but it was not accepted by GitHub...
  ##   so I used a 4096 rsa key instead.  That may soon be changing!
