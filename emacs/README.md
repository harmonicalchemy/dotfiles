# Emacs README.md

## Setup

I use SuperEmacs as my emacs base and customize from that.  If you want to use my init.el file you need to first clone SuperEmacs repository below and get your emacs working with that first.  In fact, there's no compelling reason you even need to come back here after installing SuperEmacs if you like it... I have not changed much and you will end up changing things as they come up during your own day-to-day routine... **_(as the need comes up, you will find an answer)_** That is better than having a lot of tools thrown at you all at once with no refrence point to guage them too...

**Use the following command** To clone the Super Emacs Github repository to your home directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/myTerminal/super-emacs

**-or-** Download the repository (from the same Github page) as an archive and extract it into your `home` directory.  Once done, start Emacs or well, super Emacs.

## Features

See the Super Emacs README.md file at: https://github.com/myTerminal/super-emacs for more information.  Then come back here and read through my init.el file and other extra .el files within this directory...  You will see what I have added and also what I may have excluded from the SuperEmacs base install...  But as I said, unless you came here because you saw something extra (that you Were Looking For, not just cause you thought my logo is cool [-) than you may try adding my extras on top of an existing SuperEmacs install... Sure! GO Ahead! Try it...

This is a work in progress.  Currently my init.el file depends on certian packages to be installed... I installed those packages on the fly and need to sort out which ones are needed staring right off the bat.  Once that is figured out I will add those to get automatically installed so you won't experience any errors of things not defined or whatever the first time you run my init.el in your setup!

This file will be updated once I get a turn-key setup working out of this repository... To Be continued...
