##                 List of PGP keys allowed for SSH use...

##  Environment:   GnuPG Version 2.1.11+ on Mac OS only...
##
##               **** IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE Q4-2019! ****
##
##    Dont use GPG < V2.2 anymore...  When it comes to security
##    all software needs to be as up to date as possible.  That rule applies
##    most importantly to any security related software!  Stay up to date!
##    Don't listen to anyone who says you can still be secure with older 
##    versions... Maybe you can, but why take such a cheap risk?
##    That is my advise... After saying that, I believe Harmonic Alchemy DOTFILES
##    will still work with GnuPG v2.1.11 and later... However, if you can upgrade
##    with out too much pain, I strongly recommend it!  You hvae been warned...
##
##  This file is used when support for the secure shell agent protocol has been
##  enabled (see option --enable-ssh-support in gpg-agent.conf). Only keys present
##  within this file are used in the SSH protocol. (keys witin key-cards will also
##  be used within SSH protocol if you are also using a key card)...
##
##  The ssh-add tool may be used to add new entries to this file; you may also add
##  them manually below.  Comment lines, indicated by a leading hash mark, as well
##  as empty lines are ignored. 
##
##  The only flag support is confirm. If this flag is found for a key, each use of
##  the key will pop up a pinentry to confirm the use of that key. The flag is
##  automatically set if a new key was loaded into gpg-agent using the option -c
##  of the ssh-add command.
##
##  The keygrip may be prefixed with a ! to disable an entry. (as shown below)

# List of allowed ssh keys:
# The example keys below have been added manually...
# Manual entries start with optional white spaces, followed by the keygrip of
# the key given as 40 hex digits, optionally followed by a caching TTL in seconds,
# and another optional field for arbitrary flags.  Prepend the keygrip with an '!'
# mark to disable it... A non-zero TTL overrides the global default as set by
# --default-cache-ttl-ssh within gpt-agent.conf...
#
# 1. Authentication subkey keygrip:
00005555AAAAFFFF00005555AAAAFFFF00005555
# 2. (add keys as needed)
!5555AAAAFFFF00005555AAAAFFFF00005555AAAA
# 3. (add keys as needed)
!AAAAFFFF00005555AAAAFFFF00005555AAAAFFFF
# 4. (etc...)
!FFFF00005555AAAAFFFF00005555AAAAFFFF0000
